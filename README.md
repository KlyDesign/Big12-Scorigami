# Purpose
Scorigami is the art of achieving a final score in an NFL game that has never happened before. It is a term made up by Jon Bois, a concept perfected by Pete Carroll, and a goal that may not be completed before the heat death of the universe. We took that concept and applied to every NCAA Football season to see what that chart would look like!
